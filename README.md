# alternate_energy

This python package contains some useful functions for alternate energy
systems (Wind, solar, etc.) calculations. This package will be updated
as more formulas are covered in the class I am taking. Currently, only
some basic wind energy calculations are included.

An example use case of the package is shown in the _examples_ folder.

If you run into any issues, please let me know. We can work out the issues
together.
